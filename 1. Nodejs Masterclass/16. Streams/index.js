// In Node.js, streams are a way to handle reading and writing data. They provide a way to work with large amounts of data, such as reading a large file or receiving a large amount of data over a network connection, without loading the entire dataset into memory. Streams can be readable, writable, or both, and can be used to pipe data between different sources and destinations.

import { createReadStream } from "fs";

// by default the size of the buffer is 64kb
// last buffer - remainder
// highWaterMark - control size

// ðŸ‘‡ The (highWaterMark) property controls the size of the buffer, We can (increase/decrease) that
// const stream = createReadStream("./test.txt", { highWaterMark: 90000 });

// ðŸ‘‡ We can also provide encoding to it, and it will gives us acutal content.
const stream = createReadStream("./test.txt", { encoding: "utf8" });

stream.on("data", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});

// ðŸ‘‡ We also have "error" event, which will fire if we have error
stream.on("error", (err) => console.log(err));
