# What is Node.js?

Node.js is a free, open-sourced, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that lets developers write command line tools and server-side scripts outside of a browser. [nodejs.dev](https://nodejs.dev/)

- Open-source: Node.js has a huge community of collaborators who work consistantly on keeping Node.js feature-rich and up-to-date.

- Cross-platform: Node.js code can run on any operating system like: Windows, macOS, or Linux.

- Runtime environment: Node.js is built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 engine which allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.

# Why Should You Use Node.js?

- JavaScript: Node.js is built on top of the JavaScript programming language, which means that if you already know JavaScript, you can easily learn Node.js. This makes it an attractive option for web developers who want to use a familiar language on both the front-end and back-end.

- Scalability: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it highly scalable. It can handle large volumes of traffic with ease, making it ideal for applications that need to handle a high volume of requests.

- Performance: Node.js is known for its speed and performance. Because it runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, it can execute code very quickly, making it a great choice for real-time applications.

- Large ecosystem: Node.js has a large and active community of developers who contribute to open-source packages and modules that can be easily installed using npm (Node Package Manager). This makes it easy to find pre-existing solutions to common problems and speeds up development time.

- Cross-platform: Node.js can run on multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a versatile choice for developers working across different platforms.

- Overall, Node.js is a powerful tool that offers many benefits to developers, particularly those working on real-time web applications or projects that require scalability and performance.
