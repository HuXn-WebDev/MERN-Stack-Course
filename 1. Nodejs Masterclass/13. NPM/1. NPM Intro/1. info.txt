World's biggest code store ðŸ”¥
When we install Node.js we automatically get "npm" for free.

In NPM official site, you can find anything from small things like small utility functions to large frameworks/libraries like "react/vue" etc.

NPM enable us to do three things.
    1. Reuse our own code in other projects
    2. Use code written by other developers.
    3. Share our own solution(s).

In NPM site you'll found lot's of great codebases BUT
as it's opensource so anyone can push anything, so it's on you
to find the great one's and leave the bad one's.

Pro Tip: If the number of weekly download is high, that'd be a great package/code.
