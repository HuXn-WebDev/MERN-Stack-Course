// Controlled Component ðŸ‘‡
// It's convenient to have a JS Function that:
// handles the submission of the form and
// has access to the data the user entered.

// In HTML in general forms has their own state that typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input.
// In react, mutable state is kept in the (state) of components, and only update with setState().
