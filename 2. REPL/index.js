// Read-Eval-Print Loop

// The REPL module provides a implementation that is avaliable both
// as a standalone program or includible in other applications.

// Basically it's a place where you can write/run JS code.

// .break (sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out)
// .clear (Alias for .break)
// .editor (Enter editor mode (Ctrl+D) to finish, (Ctrl+C) to cancel)
// .exit (Exit the REPL)
// .help (Print this help message)
// .load (Loads JS from a file into the REPL session e.g .load .filepath)
// .save (Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file e.g .save /filepath)
